# Penduleer

This application teaches concepts about pendulums, in a way that introduces the user to a message about something very interesting that it taught me.

Meet Ana, the math teacher! She will guide you trough and show the characteristics of the pendulums. When finished with the story, explore the Sandbox mode, where you can play with the variables that affect them!

## Instructions

#### Please make sure to run this application on Xcode while emulating an iPad (10th generation) and on portrait mode.
You can also run it on an actual 10th generation iPad.
